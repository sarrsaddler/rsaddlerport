<h2>Context</h2>
<p class="p-style">What is Bluemine Channels?</p>
  <ul >
      <li><p> Bluemine is IBM’s trusted digital source for fact-based insights about clients, competitors, and markets. Channels are collaborative spaces on Bluemine for IBMers to follow, discuss, and share content around specific market topics.</li></p>
<li><p>Design need: Redesigned the 404 error page that non-beta users of Bluemine Channels would recieve when trying to access content.</li></p>

<li><p>Process: Using the internal brand styles I created an error message page that informs the users why they cannot procced to the content.</li></p>

<li><p>Impact: Help close the gap in Bluemine’s user experience.</li></p>

    <h2>Design Procress</h2>
    <p class="p-style">How did I accomplished this project?</p>

    <div class="error-grid"> 
 
    
   
<div>
    <ul>
   <li><p>During one workweek in June of 2019, my manager assigned me the task of creating a design for a 404 error page for users that haven't signed up for channels. My manager wanted a quick turn around for this project.</p> </li>
    
<li><p>Before designing anything, I like to understand what is the nature of the task. I broke the job into three parts and took steps into educating myself.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part one - What is a 404 error page?</p>
    <p>After doing some research, I learned that the purpose of the 404 error page indicates to the user that the server couldn't make the desired request. After gaining this insight, I deem displaying a page that said 404 error was too complicated for our user base.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part two- Where will this page take users?</p>
    <p>To understand where would my error page design take users, I had to guess who would interact with this page. After reviewing the ticket, I made a note to myself that non-Bluemine channels users would land on this page. After that, I began to think about the business goals of my manager and senior leadership to push Bluemine channels. I recommended to my manager that the page should give users the following option:  opt into Bluemine channels, take them to the homepage and provide them with an opportunity to learn more.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part three- What does the messaging of this page need to sound like?</p>
    <p>Whenever I am working on a Bluemine solution, I always want to be aligned with the established writing style of the Bluemine product. I had a peer design look over my work to see if I matched the Bluemine brand.</p></li>

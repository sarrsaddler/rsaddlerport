<p class="subheader">Learn why I became a designer and quick facts about me. </p>
<p class="abtp">The first time I heard about user experience design was from a former colleague of mine back in 2017. Her job was to improve the user experience of an internal product that hosted data and market research. At that time in my professional career, I was a 20-year-old Associate analyst at IBM with two years of experience on the job. My day job consisted of making email templates and Powerpoint presentations. I grew tired of my role because it wasn't what I wanted to do anymore. I wanted to work on technology that I felt was creating an impact on someone else's life. I wanted to be in a role where my computer science skills would grow, and my intellect challenged.</p>
<p class="abtp">Fate would have it that my user experience colleague and I peer up for a stretch project.  During that time, I made sure to connect with her, and she became my mentor.</p>
<p class="abtp">Since meeting my mentor in 2017, I became an associate designer. I am still learning and improving my craft. I continue to be a designer because I feel empowered knowing I can create experiences that help others accomplish their goals.</p>

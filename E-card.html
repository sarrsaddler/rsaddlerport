        <p> Design ask: Create an E-card that works for both of English and Japanese audience.</p>
<p> Team members: I was partnered with an analyst for this project. The analyst create the content. My task was to figure out how the content should be laid within the email.</p>

<h2>Design Procress</h2>
<p class="p-style">How did I accomplished this project?</p>
<p class="text-style">What I decided to do was think about where these ecard would be sent. The primary audience would be Japanses so I decided to place the Japanese content first. Above the Japanese content I place one line in English to inform English speakers that there is the English version below. </p>


<p class="p-style">Coding</p>
<p class="text-style">I was able to code this email within a IBM development environment tool called Silverpop. I used table tag and other html tags to design this layout.</pclass="text-style">

    <ul>
   <li><p>During one workweek in June of 2019, my manager assigned me the task of creating a design for a 404 error page for users that haven't signed up for channels. My manager wanted a quick turn around for this project.</p> </li>
    
<li><p>Before designing anything, I like to understand what is the nature of the task. I broke the job into three parts and took steps into educating myself.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part one - What is a 404 error page?</p>
    <p>After doing some research, I learned that the purpose of the 404 error page indicates to the user that the server couldn't make the desired request. After gaining this insight, I deem displaying a page that said 404 error was too complicated for our user base.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part two- Where will this page take users?</p>
    <p>To understand where would my error page design take users, I had to guess who would interact with this page. After reviewing the ticket, I made a note to myself that non-Bluemine channels users would land on this page. After that, I began to think about the business goals of my manager and senior leadership to push Bluemine channels. I recommended to my manager that the page should give users the following option:  opt into Bluemine channels, take them to the homepage and provide them with an opportunity to learn more.</p></li>
    
<li><p class="p-style">Part three- What does the messaging of this page need to sound like?</p>
    <p>Whenever I am working on a Bluemine solution, I always want to be aligned with the established writing style of the Bluemine product. I had a peer design look over my work to see if I matched the Bluemine brand.</p></li>
